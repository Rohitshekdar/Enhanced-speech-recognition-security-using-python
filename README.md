# Enhancing secuirty with speech recognition: A voice-based access control
This project aims to create a hands-free speech recognition system that gives the access to the users to thier confidential data using predefined passphrases. Each individual has a unique passphrase which when matched with thier password opens their files.
In this project we have used Tkinter for the GUI and google API named Recognize_speech to detect the phrases and convert them into text and match with predefined passphrases.
